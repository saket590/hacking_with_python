**Dictionary Brute Force Attack for Security Misconfigurations:**
The script will check whether default setting credentials are present in a device or not. For example: If a device is having username:admin and password:admin, the list in the script will have multiple combinations like [admin,admin]; [admin,password];[Administrator,pass];[admin,0000], and so on.
This will help to identify security misconfigurations in the devices and servers.
